# OpenSim-Santos2017-data
Converting Santos2017 data to OpenSim for analysis.

The file mkr_names is used to convert the marker names from the Santos convention to any convention you prefer, for example the markers in the Rajagopal model. Note that not all markers from the Santos publication are present in the model. You can add these yourself in OpenSim and save the new marker set.

It is currently not yet possible to load the force plate data, let me know if you plan to use this, I can help you with the data conversion.
